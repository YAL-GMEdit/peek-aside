# Peek Aside
This [GMEdit](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmedit) plugin allows you to quickly open a script for viewing/editing in a side panel.

It is largely inspired by [Peek Definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-view-and-edit-code-by-using-peek-definition-alt-plus-f12?view=vs-2019) in Visual Studio and GameMaker Studio 2's own workflow with layered popouts.

The default keybindings are Alt-F1 / Alt-F12; keybinding name is "Peek Aside";  
Performing the keybinding inside the side panel will open a new file in it while using the regular "Open declaration" binding (default: F1 / F12) will switch and focus the main panel, allowing you to juggle editors.

You can close the side view using Esc or Ctrl+W. If the side view's file is not currently active in the main panel, the file will be closed.
